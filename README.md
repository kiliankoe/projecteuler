## Project Euler

These are my solutions for the problems from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/). Judge me on the implementations if you feel like it, but please regard the timestamp of the commit. Not sure if I'll fix old smelly code.

### C

Should compile with probably any C compiler out there and the most standard flags and whatnot. Simple stuff.
This is also old and stupid code.

### Swift

Will obviously only run on a Mac (for now). Either throw it into a playground, but be aware that this is bogged down by all the instruments and stuff (also for now) and might run a lot better actually compiled.

They can also be run on the commandline with `xcrun swift path/to/file` or `xcrun swiftc path/to/file` (to compile it). You might need to select the Xcode beta version first with `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode6-Beta.app/Contents/Developer`.
